# Tweetwise #

Tweetwise is my attempt to create an automated system for Bitcoin trading, implementing the techniques described in Colianni et al. to build a predictive model based on Twitter sentiment analysis [1].


## Twitter + Bitcoin data ##
I spent ~4 months collecting data, based on the methods described in the paper. You can download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzqCBdvJ6j-nUzRZckRJUVJwY00).
